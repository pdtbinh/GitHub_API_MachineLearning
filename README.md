#Futurice Academy 2021 - Homework Assignment

This is my solution to the Homework assignment belongs to Futurice Academy application on September 2021.

<b>Learning track</b>: Data Specialist in cloud native environment

Homework: Machine Learning - Use GitHub's REST API to extract information of a repo (issues, stars, watchers, etc.) and predict the amount of contribution (number of contributors) of the project. The model will be trained on approximately 5,800 datapoints.
List of content:
Retrieve Data (approx. 7,100 datapoints)
Clean Data (approx. 5,800 datapoints left)
Visualize Data
Preprocess Data
Build Model
Train/Validate Model
Test Model
Conclusion
Additional comments: This project could be useful in practice where a user wants their project to achieve a certain amount of attentions, the machine would tell the user approximately how many co-creators needed for a project of that scale. Due to the limited amount of times GitHub API allow me to fetch information, the model in this homework will focus mainly on the aforementioned problem, but given more resources, the model could be scaled to solve much bigger problem such as suggesting collaborators for the user's project.
